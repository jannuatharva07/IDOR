# Hacktivity Reports

## 1. **IDOR - Accessing Payment Data of Other Users**
**Report ID:** 751577  
**What Happened:**  
An attacker sent a request to the server with a `userid` parameter. They changed the `userid` and were able to see the payment details of other users.  
**Lesson Learned:**  
Test APIs to make sure that changing the user ID in the URL or request doesn’t let someone see or access other users' private data. This is called **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**.

### 2. **IDOR - Deleting Other User's Certifications**
**Report ID:** 2122671  
**What Happened:**  
The attacker was logged into two accounts (Account A and Account B) at the same time. They created certifications in both accounts. By using a burp, they changed the ID in the request to delete certifications from another user’s account.  
**Lesson Learned:**  
Make sure users can only delete or edit their own data. Don’t allow one user to delete or modify another user's information.

### 3. **IDOR - Deleting Campaigns**
**Report ID:** 1969141  
**What Happened:**  
The attacker found that the IDs of campaigns were not hidden. By changing the campaign ID in the URL, the attacker was able to delete someone else's campaign.  
**Lesson Learned:**  
Always hide or encrypt IDs in requests. If users can easily change IDs in URLs, they might be able to perform actions they shouldn't, like deleting data from other users.

### 4. **IDOR - Missing Ownership Check on Remote Wipe**
**Report ID:** 319807  
**What Happened:**  
There was a feature to remotely wipe a user’s device using this URL:
/settings/p/auth/wipe/{device_id}

But the server didn’t check if the device belonged to the person making the request.  
By changing `{device_id}` to another user’s ID, an attacker could wipe someone else’s device.  
**Lesson:** Always verify **ownership** before performing sensitive operations.

### 5. **IDOR - Edit Anyone's Blog/Website Info**
**Report ID:** 974222  
**What Happened:**  
1. Attacker and victim had accounts on a website.  
2. Victim added a blog/website in their profile settings.  
3. Attacker viewed source code and noted the victim’s `id`.  
4. Attacker went to their own profile, intercepted the blog/website update request using Burp Suite.  
5. They changed the `id` to the victim’s and were able to change victim's blog info.

**Lesson:** Never allow users to update other users’ data just by changing an ID.

### 6. **IDOR - Account Takeover via Edit User (Crowd Signal)**
**Report ID:** 915114  
**What Happened:**  
There was an endpoint that let users edit their own account info.  
By modifying the `id` in the request URL, the attacker accessed and edited other users’ data.

**Lesson:** Never trust just the `id` in a request — **always verify the user behind the ID.**

**Steps to Reproduce:**
1. Go to product page on `xyz.com`, add item to cart.
2. Fill in details, go to checkout.
3. Intercept the request using **Burp Suite**.
4. Modify the `price` parameter in the request before it reaches the server.
