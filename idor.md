# IDOR

## Definition

IDOR stands for **Insecure Direct Object Reference**.  
It is a **subcategory of Access Control vulnerabilities**.

*PortSwigger Definition ‚Äî  
IDOR arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.*

In simple words, IDOR is a vulnerability where the application fails to enforce proper access control, allowing an **unauthorized user to access or manipulate resources** they shouldn't be able to access.

### üß™ Example

Imagine a web application that stores user invoices:  
Ravi accesses his invoice using this URL:  
`https://example.com/invoice?id=1001`  

Now, if Sam changes the ID to `1002`:  
`https://example.com/invoice?id=1002`  

‚Äî and he can see **Ravi's invoice** without authorization, this indicates an **IDOR vulnerability**.

Why? Because the application is **directly referencing objects (like invoice IDs)** without verifying **if the user is allowed to access them**.

## Scenarios - IDOR
### 1. Retrieve a Database Record  
   URL has something like:`https://foo.bar/somepage?invoice=12345`  
   The invoice value is used directly to fetch data from the database.  
   If you change the ID (e.g. 12346), you may get another user‚Äôs invoice ‚Üí ‚ùó IDOR

### 2. Perform an Operation in the System  
   URL:`https://foo.bar/changepassword?user=someuser`   
   The user parameter tells the app whose password to change.  
   If the app doesn‚Äôt check who is logged in, changing the user value can let you reset someone else‚Äôs password ‚Üí ‚ùó IDOR

### 3. Retrieve a File System Resource  
   URL:`https://foo.bar/showImage?img=img00011`  
   The img parameter directly decides which file to load.  
   If you change it to another file (e.g. img=img00012), and it works ‚Üí ‚ùó IDOR  
   *`‚ö†Ô∏è May also work with Path Traversal (e.g., img=../../secret.txt)`*
### 4. Accessing Functionality via Parameter
   URL:`https://foo.bar/accessPage?menuitem=12`
   The menuitem controls what feature/page you access.
   If you‚Äôre only allowed menuitem=1,2,3 but access 12 anyway ‚Üí ‚ùó IDOR
