# IDOR

## Definition

IDOR stands for **Insecure Direct Object Reference**.  
It is a **subcategory of Access Control vulnerabilities**.

*PortSwigger Definition â€”  
IDOR arises when an application uses user-supplied input to access objects directly.*

In simple words, IDOR is a vulnerability where the application fails to enforce proper access control, allowing an **unauthorized user to access or manipulate resources** that they shouldn't have access to.
